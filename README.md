# GAN-based-Medical-Image-Enhancement-model
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to enhance the quality of medical images such as MRI, CT, and X-ray scans. The model improves image resolution, reduces noise, and preserves structural details using deep learning and adversarial training. Built with Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and OpenCV
